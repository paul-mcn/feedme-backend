        "notes": "1. Meat – Some traditional slow cooked Bolognese Sauce are made with a mixture of beef and pork mince. Beef for flavour, pork for juiciness. I typically do not use this for midweek.\n2. Beef stock cubes – I use Oxo Beef Cubes (Woolies & Coles). Use any beef bouillon / stock cube or in powder form (called “granulated beef bouillon” in some countries). If using a powder, use 2 tsp (ie 1 tsp per 1 cube).\n3. Canned tomato – Mid range canned tomato can be notoriously sour. A touch of sugar makes an incredible difference. The amount required will depend on how sweet / sour the tomatoes and tomato paste is – go by taste. Typically, the better the quality, the less sour they are so the less sugar you will need.\n4. Tossing pasta sauce – See commentary in post about emulsifying the pasta sauce. This is the “proper” Italian way to cook pastas, and the way pasta is served in restaurants.\n5. Slow simmer option – this is how you take a great bolognese to an incredible one that would make your Italian Nonna proud. The key here is ultra low heat – after bringing to simmer, lower heat so the surface is just gently rippling, with a few bubbles here and there. Once the lid has been on for a while, take a peek to check – because it gets hotter with the lid on. I use my smallest burner on the lowest setting.\n6. Other notes:\n* Scaling recipe up (use auto recipe scaler) – If you double the recipe (or more!), then brown the beef in batches. If you try to cook it in one batch, you will end up stewing it rather than browning!\n* Slow cooker: This is really fantastic made in a slow cooker! The meat becomes so tender and the sauce has incredible flavour. At step 3, cook until the wine liquid disappears completely, then transfer it into the slow cooker at step 4 and cook for low for 6 hours.\n* Variations: Here are some ideas for ways to take this up a notch, if you are so inclined!\n– Finely chop 1 carrot + celery and saute that with the onion to make a softrito. Cook on medium low heat for 10 minutes for extra amazingness!\n– Add finely chopped bacon (smokey is the ultimate!) or pancetta, cook with the onion\n– 1 tbsp soy sauce (my mother did this, I sometimes do! I’ve seen it in some chef recipes)\n– Fresh or dried red chilli\n– Bolognese gets better the longer it is cooked, and it’s even better the next day!",

        "notes": "1. Buk Choy is an Asian vegetable, as pictured. Stems take longer to cook than the leaves, so best to cut leaves off and add towards the end of the cook time. Stems vary vastly in width (outer layers thick, inner layers small) so cut them into even size so they cook at the same time. Do the same for all similar shaped Asian Greens. There's no need to be 100% exact here - if some leaves end up in the stem batch, it's totally fine! You just want MOST added later in the cook time.\n2. Soy sauce - use light or all purpose soy sauce here. Do not use Dark Soy Sauce - the flavour is too intense and will overpower the sauce. The bottle will be labelled 'dark soy sauce'. Gluten free - use tarmari.\n3. Chinese Cooking Wine ('Shaoxing wine') is the secret ingredient that really makes a restaurant standard Chinese sauce. You get complexity and depth in the sauce with just a bit of the cooking wine. SUBSTITUTES: Mirin - best, the Japanese equivalent of Chinese cooking wine; Dry sherry - next best, any cheap and cheerful dry sherry; Japanese cooking sake; Non alcoholic - substitute the water in the recipe with LOW SODIUM chicken stock/broth\n4. CHARLIE is my All Purpose Stir Fry Sauce. If you haven't met him yet and you love stir fries, you are going to be best friends very soon. Find the recipe for him here, along with how to use him. To use Charlie for this recipe, replace the Sauce with 4 tablespoons of Charlie + 3/4 tsp cornflour / cornstarch + 3/4 cup water, then use per recipe.",

Sugar – Use this if you know the tomatoes are underripe and a bit sour. Start with 1/2 tsp then add more if needed.\n4. Cream – Just a bit of cream adds a lovely mouthfeel to soups. We’re not trying to make it really rich and creamy! Butter adds a similar touch.\n5. Basil – This soup is designed to taste great even if you don’t have fresh basil. Don’t buy a whole bunch just for this recipe – unless you’ve got company! And if you do, feel free to stir in lots more. 🙂\nStorage – Fridge 4 days, freezer 3 months.",

        "notes": "You could totally just make this with the kale and tahini dressing if you’re just in need of a tasty kale side salad. Everything else are add-ins that makes this into a satisfying, interesting meal-size-salad!\n1. Tuscan kale, also called cavolo nero, black or lacinato kale, has leaves shaped more like silverbeet (chard) slightly flatter than curly kale so more suited to cutting into slaw-like strips and the leaves are slightly softer too. To use regular curly kale, chop into bite size pieces (don’t slice thinly, doesn’t really work well). Removing the leaf off the stem – Grab and rip it off! Quick ‘n easy, watch the video 🙂\n2. Chicken – I use store bought roast chicken. If cooking your own, I recommend poaching it using this method. Shred then toss with a pinch of salt and pepper before using.\n3. Tahini – Mix well if the oil is separated. If it’s set like cement, microwave to warm (it will loosen) then use a stick blender. Hulled is lighter in colour (standard tahini). Unhulled tahini is darker and more bitter (harder to find), I don’t use this.\n4. Roasted chickpeas should be crispy on the outside but still soft on the inside (else they are like little rocks!). 10 minutes dry roasting makes them extra crisp (better than air or towel drying) though they will start to soften after an hour or so. For ultra crisp though, and longer lasting crisp, you need to deep fry. Re-crisp by popping in the oven for 5 minutes or so (same temp per recipe).\n5. Storage – Oil rubbed kale will keep just fine for 2 days. Keep the components separate then assemble when required. Crispy chickpeas can be revived – see above note.",

        "notes": "1. Soft rolls best so everything kind of melds together. Aim for a slab that will fit snugly in a 23 x 33cm / 9 x 13\" pan. Australia: 12 Bakers Delight rolls fit perfectly, that's what I use :) US: Hawaiian rolls are the perfect size, 12 large or 24 small.\n2. Mustard - American mustard is the classic here though you can use any mild mustard. Not hot English mustard (too spicy!) and not wholegrain (too bumpy).\n3. Ham quantity - If using ham you bought or glazed then slice yourself, you can easily increase this to 500g / 1 lb. The lower amount is for shaved or thinly sliced store bought ham.\n4. Poppyseeds - Traditionally used, adds nuttiness and visual effect, plus you get to make fun of everybody who gets the seeds stuck in their teeth. But don't make a special trip just to find them. Worth making without!\n5. Pan - If you don't have a pan this size, use a tray with foil and wrap the bread to hold the butter in as it bakes.\n6. Baking topless - Important step to ensure cheese melts. If you try with bread lid on at the start, it takes almost an hour before cheese melts. Or, accept the cheese won't fully melt. (I can't accept that).\n7. Recipe credits - Created with reference to many recipes found online such as the NYT Cooking one and this one from The Kitchn, except, as noted in post, the cheese didn't melt which is not cool so I changed the method.\nLeftovers will keep for 3 to 4 days (subject to remaining shelf life of ham used). Revive by reheating in the oven.",
